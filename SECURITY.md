# Security Notice

## API Key Exposure Incident - July 4, 2025

### Summary
A Firebase API key was inadvertently exposed in the public repository between commits. Google's security monitoring detected this exposure and sent an alert.

### Affected Resources
- Firebase API Key: `AIzaSyAIheFA9pjV634YCVezKxgEIug4rlNS70g` (now revoked)
- Project: offscript-8f6eb

### Actions Taken
1. ✅ Removed hardcoded API keys from source code
2. ✅ Added environment files to `.gitignore`
3. ✅ Replaced with placeholder values
4. ⏳ **REQUIRED**: Regenerate new Firebase API key
5. ⏳ **REQUIRED**: Update production environment with new key

### Next Steps Required
1. **Immediately regenerate the Firebase API key** in the Google Cloud Console
2. Update the production environment variables with the new key
3. Update `public/environment.js` with the new key (keep this file out of git)
4. Test that the application still works with the new key

### Prevention Measures
